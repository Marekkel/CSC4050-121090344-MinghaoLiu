Features such as 'format as table', conditional formatting, and other advanced items are not inspected or captured. For these, only the data value in the cells will be captured. \n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.19\n--------------------- \nAdded a better handler for date format detection and conversion. This is still very hacky but it works. \nMS date format to datetime strftime is never going to be straight forward until there is a method to \nobtain the resulting formatted string by itself.\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.18\n--------------------- \nInline double-pipe separator had a bug where a newline in the cell requires the wiki table to use a single pipe character.\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.17\n--------------------- \nFor better presentation of empty cells in wiki the cell contents are replaced with '&nbsp;' this retains any spacing/sizing related nature of the table which would otherwise collapse.\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.16\n--------------------- \nWiki text within a cell was not being formatted via wiki because of being inlined. Slight update to fix this.\nThe 'INLINE_FMT' flag is now deprecated.\n\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.15\n--------------------- \nAdded preserve_width option\nUpdate to latest openpyxl - note that newer openpyxl broke something in colwidth with 0.1.14\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.14\n--------------------- \n\nMinor update\n\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.13\n--------------------- \n\nAdded a version from git tag\nHandling numeric, date and percent values a bit better\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.12\n--------------------- \n\nCleanup release\n\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.11 \n--------------------- \nAdded support for inline format with double-pipe notation.\nRemoved unneeded imports.\nMinor fixes to value retrieval\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.10 \n--------------------- \n\nPackaging was not following best practice of examples within the package. \nBug fix: Unicode was not correctly handled. \n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.9 \n-------------------- \n\nMinor font issues fixed. Italics and font-name were being ignored. \nSome other minor items fixed. \n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.8 \n-------------------- \n\nAdded support for hyperlinks: \n\n- Unfortunately openpyxl does not yet support reading hyperlinks. \n- The way to enter hyperlinks is to place the hyperlink and wiki display text in a cell, such as: \"http://yahoo.com Yahoo!\" \n- Any cell containing \"http\" will be wrapped within []s. \n\nBugs: \n----- \n\n- Caption was missing, added it back. \n- Caption style was incorrectly set. fixed. \n- unneeded parameter headerRow removed. \n- unneeded cellToWiki method removed \n\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.7 \n-------------------- \nCleaner output of wiki text. \n- Common cell styles across the row are boiled up to row style. \n- Common row style items are boiled up to table. \n\n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.6 \n-------------------- \nMinor: black was being ignored for bg color as well. Instead of only the fg color \n\nRelease Notes: 0.1.5 \n-------------------- \n\n* Added border as default. \n* Removed font color from markup when color is black  \n\n",

ØMQ socket\noperations that would normally block the current thread will only block the\ncurrent greenlet instead.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* pyzmq==2.2.0\n* gevent (compatible with 1.0 pre-releases as well)\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInstead of importing zmq directly, do so in the following manner:\n\n..\n    \n    from gevent_zeromq import zmq\n\n\nAny calls that would have blocked the current thread will now only block the\ncurrent green thread.\n\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nThis compatibility is accomplished by ensuring the nonblocking flag is set\nbefore any blocking operation and the ØMQ file descriptor is polled internally\nto trigger needed events.\n\nWill build with cython if available, decreasing overhead.\n\nLicense\n-------\nSee LICENSE (New BSD)\n\n",

Allows you to proxy any website behind a prefix.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ 2.x superior to 2.5 and Django\n- `Django <http://www.djangoproject.org>`_  >= 1.2\n- `restkit <http://benoitc.github.com/restkit>`_ >= 2.3.2\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall from sources::\n\n  $ python setup.py install\n\nOr from Pypi::\n\n  $ easy_install -U dj-revproxy \n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nAdd `revproxy`  to the list of applications::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'revproxy'\n    )\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nSince 0.2, there is 2 ways to use dj-revproxy.\n\n\n1. Generic view\n+++++++++++++++\n\nYou can use ``proxy_request`` function to proxy any url. You can use it in your code::\n\n    proxy_request(request, \"http://example.com\")\n\nThis code will proxy current request to ``http://example.com`` domain.\nThis function can take 5 parameters:\n\n- destination: string, the proxied url. Required\n- path: string, If no path is given it will try to detect the url using\n  the prefix if it's given. If not full request.path will be used in\n  finl destination url.\n- prefix: string, the prrefix behind we proxy the path\n  headers: dict, custom HTTP headers\n- no_redirect: boolean, False by default, do not redirect to \"/\" \n  if no path is given\n- decompress: boolean, False by default. If true the proxy will\n  decompress the source body if it's gzip encoded.\n\nIt return an instance of ``django.http.HttpResponse``. You can use it  directly\nin your urls.py (which is the eaiest way to use). Ex::\n\n    (r'^gunicorn(?P<path>.*)', \"revproxy.proxy.proxy_request\", {\n        \"destination\": \"http://gunicorn.org\"\n    }),\n\n2. Configure multiple proxy behind one generic prefix\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTo configure a proxy add a tupple to the REVPROXY_SETTINGS list::\n\n    REVPROXY_SETTINGS = [\n        (\"_google\", \"http://google.com\"),\n        (\"_friendpaste\", \"http://www.friendpaste.com\"),\n        (\"_couchdb\", \"http://127.0.0.1:5984\"),\n    ]\n\nThen configure your proxied urls automatically do something like this in\n``urls.py``:: \n    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *\n\n    import revproxy.proxy\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        ...\n        (r'^proxy/', include(proxy.site_proxy.urls)),\n    )\n\nWhich will allow you to proxy Google on the url::\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:8000/proxy/_google\n\nor even::\n\n    ('^proxy/(?P<prefix>[^\\/]*)(.*)', \"proxy.site_proxy\"),\n\n\n",
